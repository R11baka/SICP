; Exercise 2.49.  Use segments->painter to define the following primitive painters:

; a.  The painter that draws the outline of the designated frame.

; b.  The painter that draws an ``X'' by connecting opposite corners of the frame.

; c.  The painter that draws a diamond shape by connecting the midpoints of the sides
; of the frame.

; d.  The wave painter.

; SOLUTION

(require (planet "sicp.ss" ("soegaard" "sicp.plt" 2 1)))

; Note: The implementation of the procedure segments->painter in the textbook
; is different from the similarly named procedure in the sicp plt package.
;
; The plt package procedure takes a list of segments and draws them. Moreover,
; this procedure draws segments only inside the unit square where 0 <= x,y <= 1. Any
; points ouside the unit square are simply ignored (at least, there is no visual
; output)
;
; The textbook implementation also takes a list of segments but instead of drawing them
; directly, evaluates to a procedure that takes a frame as its input.
; This procedure when supplied with a frame, maps all the segments from the originally
; supplied list to this frame and then draws them. Now, the 'draw-line' procedure
; in the textbook implementation has no equivalent in the plt package. So in order
; to use the plt package implementation of segments->painter, I have modified the
; textbook implementation of segments->painter
;
; Finally, to prevent a name-clash, I have renamed the textbook procedure by
; appending a '-local' suffix
